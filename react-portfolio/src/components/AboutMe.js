                <p>I am fairly new to software and web development, I have spent the last 7 years in the logistics and trade industry. Throughout that time I gained a lot of experience. Not only with computers and navigating programs, but also creating and maintaining strong relationships with cliental and team members. I am now looking to expand what I have learned over this time and incorporate it into future positions I may get in the coding world.</p>
